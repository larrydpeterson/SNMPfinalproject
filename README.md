# SNMPfinalproject
Explore SNMP functionality


Business Software Development II – Final Project
In Business Software Development I for my final project I worked on code that would allow me to save
Cisco networking configurations to a file. For my BSDII final, I’d like to continue in that theme, but
explore the SNMP protocol to communicate with the Cisco device.
Things I’d like to attempt (I’m not sure how feasible they are yet, but will explore the feasibly), are to
create a java gui that can store device information in a database (e.g. device name, device IP address,
SNMP credentials). I would then use that information to be able to select a device and communicate
with it using SNMP to pull and display configuration information. The next step would be to pull
statistical information (e.g. interface throughput, error counters) and display those graphically. I would
then continue on to potentially allow simple interface configuration changes (e.g. change what vlan a
port is assigned to). If all of that is completed and time permits, I may add in some features that allow
for location information be stored in the database, and create a small network map based on those
coordinates.
